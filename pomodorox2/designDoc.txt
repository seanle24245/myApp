### App Design

#### Objective
To allow users to study more efficiently using a customizable pomodoro timer with the added benefit of a period where users must log what they've learned through either audio
or video, as the best way to learn is to be able to explain and articulate the subject.  Users would be able to view all of their learning logs to see what they've learned by
the hour.  Users could make categories so they can also see how much time they are spending on each subject.  Audio logging is preffered as speaking/teaching a subject is 
a great way to learn. users can rate study sessions on how focused/productive they were.

#### Audience

Students primarily, but anyone who needs to focus on a subject (usually content heavy subjects) and would get help from being more organized with studying.  Anyone who has trouble focusing for an extended amount of time.  Anyone who doesn't have a way of tracking what they've learned.

#### Experience

Users will just start the app by clicking on the start button and will continue the process of focusing, recording, and breaking until they'd like to stop.  Users could open the app whenever they want to see their study logs and progress with efficient studying.

### MVP Milestones
[The overall milestones of first usable build, core features, and polish are just suggestions, plan to finish earlier if possible. The last 20% of work tends to take about as much time as the first 80% so do not slack off on your milestones!]

#### Week 1
_planning your app_
* Come up with an idea

#### Week 2
_finishing a usable build_
* Finish UI

#### Week 3
* Create classes

#### Week 4
* Finish timers

#### Week 5
_starting the polish_
* Finish audio logger and scrubber

#### Week 6
_submitting to the App Store_
* Polish everything
